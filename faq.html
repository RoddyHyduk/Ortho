				<h2 class="ltgray-text">Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
			</div>

				<h3 class="section-heading">About Teeth</h3>

					<div class="indent">

						<h4 class="subsection-heading">Will my teeth straighten out as they grow?</h4>
						<p>Unfortunately, no. Available space for your front teeth does not increase as your teeth grow. In fact for most patients, after the permanent molars erupt, the space available for the front teeth decreases with age.</p><br>

						<h4 class="subsection-heading">Can orthodontic correction occur even if my child still has baby teeth?</h4>
						<p>Possibly! Some orthodontic problems are significant enough to require early intervention. However, if a patient is not yet ready for treatment, we will follow that patient's growth and development until the time is right for treatment to begin. Click <a class="stong" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold; color: #ffd400;" href="treatment.html#kids">here</a> to learn more about Two Phase Treatment for your child.</p><br>

						<h4 class="subsection-heading">Will I need to have any teeth extracted for braces?</h4>
						<p>Removing teeth is sometimes required to achieve the best orthodontic results. Straight teeth and a balanced facial profile are the goals of orthodontics; however, because new technology provides advanced orthodontic procedures, removing teeth is not always necessary for exceptional treatment.</p><br>

						<h4 class="subsection-heading">Can I wear braces even though I have crowns and missing teeth?</h4>
						<p>Absolutely! A tooth with a crown will move just like a tooth with a simple filling. When teeth are missing, orthodontic treatment will aid in the alignment of the remaining teeth.</p>

					</div>
					<br>

				<h3 class="section-heading">About Treatment</h3>

					<div class="indent">

						<h4 class="subsection-heading">How long will it take to complete my treatment?</h4>
						<p>Treatment time obviously depends on each patient's specific orthodontic problems. In general, treatment times range anywhere from 12-30 months. The "average" time a patient wears braces is approximately 22 months.</p><br>

						<h4 class="subsection-heading">Will my braces hurt?</h4>
						<p>Generally, braces do not "hurt." After certain visits, teeth may be sore for a few days, but in these situations painmedications (such as Advil or Tylenol) will ease the discomfort. However, after most visits, patients do not feel any soreness at all! We often remind our patients, braces don’t have to hurt to work!</p><br>

						<h4 class="subsection-heading">Are there foods I cannot eat while I have braces?</h4>
						<p>Sadly, yes. Once treatment begins, we will review instructions for care and provide a comprehensive list of foods to avoid. Some of these foods include: ice, hard candy, raw vegetables and all sticky foods (such as caramel and gum). You can avoid most emergency appointments to repair broken or damaged braces by carefully following our instructions.</p><br>


						<h4 class="subsection-heading">Will my braces prevent me from participating in sports or playing a musical instrument?</h4>
						<p>Playing an instrument or a contact sport may require some adjustment when you first get your braces, but wearing braces will not stop you from participating in these activities! If you play a contact sport, it is recommended that you wear a mouthguard to protect your braces or appliance.</p><br>

						<h4 class="subsection-heading">If I have braces, do I still need dental checkups every six months?</h4>
						<p>Yes! In fact, it's even more important that patients receiving orthodontic treatment visit their dentistsregularly. With braces, food may be caught in places that your toothbrush can't reach. This causes bacteria to build up and can lead to cavities, gingivitis, and gum disease. Your dentist will work closely with Dr. Hyduk to make sure that your teeth stay clean and healthy during treatment.</p>
					
					</div>
					<br>



					<h3 class="section-heading">About Appointments</h3>

					<div class="indent">

						<h4 class="subsection-heading">How often will I have appointments?</h4>
						<p>Appointments are scheduled according to each patient's needs. Most patients in braces need to be seen every 5-10 weeks. If there are specific situations that require more frequent monitoring, we will schedule appointments accordingly.</p><br>

						<h4 class="subsection-heading">Can I schedule all of my child's appointments after school?</h4>
						<p>Unfortunately, we cannot schedule all appointments for students during after-school hours. However, because most appointments are scheduled 5-10 weeks apart, we do our best to have our patients miss minimal school. We will, however, make a sincere effort to meet your scheduling needs.</p><br>

						<h4 class="subsection-heading">Can I drop my child off for an appointment?</h4>
						<p>Yes. We understand your busy schedule and we are happy to help you make the most of your time. On some occasions, we may request to speak with a parent after an appointment, so we ask that parents check in with our front desk before leaving the office.</p><br>

						<h4 class="subsection-heading">What is an emergency appointment? How are those handled?</h4>
						<p>If your braces are causing extreme pain or some part breaks. please call our office immediately. In most cases, we will be able to address these issues over the phone. If you require an emergency appointment, we will set aside time for you.</p>
