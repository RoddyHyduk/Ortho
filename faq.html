				<h2 class="ltgray-text">Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
			</div>

				<h3 class="section-heading">About Teeth</h3>

					<div class="indent">

						<h4 class="subsection-heading">Will my teeth straighten out as they grow?</h4>
						<p>No, they will not. The space available for the front teeth does not increase as you grow. In most people, after the permanent molars erupt, the space available for the front teeth decreases with age.</p><br>

						<h4 class="subsection-heading">Can orthodontic correction occur while a child has baby teeth?</h4>
						<p>Yes. Some orthodontic problems are significant enough to require early intervention. However, if a patient is not yet ready for treatment, we will follow that patient's growth and development until the time is right for treatment to begin.</p><br>

						<h4 class="subsection-heading">Will I need to have teeth extracted for braces?</h4>
						<p>Removing teeth is sometimes required to achieve the best orthodontic result. Straight teeth and a balanced facial profile are the goal of orthodontics. However, because new technology has provided advanced orthodontic procedures, removing teeth is not always necessary for orthodontic treatment.</p><br>

						<h4 class="subsection-heading">Can I wear braces even though I have crowns and missing teeth?</h4>
						<p>Yes. A tooth with a crown will move just like a tooth with a simple filling. When teeth are missing, orthodontic treatment will aid in the alignment of the remaining teeth.</p>

					</div>
					<br>



				<h3 class="section-heading">About Treatment</h3>

					<div class="indent">

						<h4 class="subsection-heading">How long will it take to complete treatment?</h4>
						<p>Treatment time obviously depends on each patient's specific orthodontic problem. In general, treatment times range from 12 to 30 months. The "average" time frame a person is in braces is approximately 22 months.</p><br>

						<h4 class="subsection-heading">Do braces hurt?</h4>
						<p>Generally, braces do not "hurt." After certain visits, teeth may be sore for a few days. In these situations, pain medications such as Advil or Tylenol will ease the discomfort. However, after most visits, patients do not feel any soreness at all! We often remind our patients, It does not have to hurt to work!</p><br>

						<h4 class="subsection-heading">Are there foods I cannot eat while I have braces?</h4>
						<p>Yes. Once treatment begins, we will explain the complete instructions and provide a comprehensive list of foods to avoid. Some of those foods include: ice, hard candy, raw vegetables and all sticky foods (i.e. caramel and taffy). You can avoid most emergency appointments to repair broken or damaged braces by carefully following our instructions.</p><br>


						<h4 class="subsection-heading">Will my braces interfere with my school activities like sports or playing an instrument?</h4>
						<p>Playing an instrument or a contact sport may require some adjustment when you first get your braces, but wearing braces will not stop you from participating in any of your school activities. If you play a contact sport, it is recommended that you wear a mouthguard to protect your braces or appliance.</p><br>

						<h4 class="subsection-heading">If I have braces, do I still need dental checkups every six months?</h4>
						<p>Yes! In fact, it's even more important that patients receiving orthodontic treatment visit their dentist regularly. With braces, food may be caught in places that your toothbrush can't reach. This causes bacteria to build up that can lead to cavities, gingivitis, and gum disease. Your dentist will work closely with your orthodontist to make sure that your teeth stay clean and healthy while wearing braces.</p>
					
					</div>
					<br>



					<h3 class="section-heading">About Appointments</h3>

					<div class="indent">

						<h4 class="subsection-heading">How often will I have appointments?</h4>
						<p>Appointments are scheduled according to each patient's needs. Most patients in braces will be seen every 5 to 10 weeks. If there are specific situations that require more frequent monitoring, we will schedule appointments accordingly.</p><br>

						<h4 class="subsection-heading">Can I schedule all of my appointments after school?</h4>
						<p>Unfortunately, we cannot schedule all appointments for students during after-school hours. However, because most appointments are scheduled 5 to 10 weeks apart, most patients will miss minimal school due to their orthodontic treatments. We will, however, make a sincere effort to meet your scheduling needs.</p><br>

						<h4 class="subsection-heading">Can I drop my child off for an appointment?</h4>
						<p>Yes. We understand your busy schedule, and we are happy to help you make the most of your time. On some occasions, we may request to speak with a parent when they return, so we ask that parents check in with the orthodontic assistant before leaving the office.</p><br>

						<h4 class="subsection-heading">What is an emergency appointment? How are those handled?</h4>
						<p>If your braces are causing extreme pain or if something breaks, you should call our office. In most cases we can address these issues over the telephone. If you require an emergency appointment, we will set aside time for you. </p>
